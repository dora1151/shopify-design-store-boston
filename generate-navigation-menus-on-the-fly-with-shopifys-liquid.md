# Generate Navigation Menus on the Fly with Shopify's Liquid
As a developer at [Hybrid Web Agency](https://hybridwebagency.com/), focused on frontend optimizations, responsive design is crucial. From phone browsing to tablet interactions, the user experience determines brand perception. However, static templates struggle as stores evolve rapidly.

I was driven to explore Shopify's dynamic Liquid framework more deeply to tackle this challenge. By dynamically querying content sections, components like navigation automatically mirror changes without duplicate template edits. Store owners need only update content in one place, assured rollouts remain consistent.

When building for flourishing e-commerce, rigid structures gradually lose relevance over time. As inventories and pages mature constantly, static interfaces cannot keep pace. Thankfully, Liquid equips developers to directly relate interfaces to live content sources.

Prominent examples that benefit are navigational elementsâ€”arguably the most impactful on journeys. Instead of inflexible links, envision adaptable systems eternally optimized.

This guide illuminates building fully responsive, dynamically updating menus using Liquid templating fundamentals. Readers will learn nesting HTML, section querying, and fluid integrations for limitless growth support. Now let's explore techniques empowering navigation fluidity!

By implementing these best practices, themes stay future-proofed regardless of unpredictable changes. Users receive optimized experiences throughout stores' lifetimes.

## Define Navbar Structure with Liquid

The first step is to create the navbar template file - `navbar.liquid` - that will contain our dynamic menu markup. Inside this file, we'll start with some basic HTML structure:

```liquid
<nav id="navbar">
  <ul>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

This defines the outer `<nav>` element with an `id` for styling purposes. Within it is an unordered list `<ul>` that will eventually contain our navigation links. 

For optimal accessibility, we always want to start navbar links inside a list element rather than loose text. The empty `<ul>` is where our generated links will be output later using Liquid code.

Next, we need to query our Shopify backend for the navigation data that will populate this structure. Specifically, we want to retrieve global sections like "Products" or "Blog" that will form the top-level items.

Shopify provides a convenient `sections` object for this which we can access using Liquid's `include` tag. Let's add that below the empty `<ul>`:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% include 'sections' %}
{% endraw %}
```

This embeds the section data directly into our template. In the next section, we'll see how to efficiently loop through and output those sections as our dynamic menu links.


Here is another variation on the section:

## Illuminating the Navigation with Live Links

It's now time to shine a light on our navigation and illuminate it using dynamic data from Shopify sections. 

Within the `navbar.liquid` file, below the placeholder unordered list, insert this code to tap into the power source:

```liquid
{% for section in sections %}

  <li>
    <a href="{{ section.url }}">
      {{ section.title }}
    </a>
  </li>

{% endfor %}
```

With this `for` loop passing through the `sections` array, a new menu item will illuminate on each pass like a light switching on. 

Each item houses an anchor link drawing its destination straight from the section URL definition. The familiar display title likewise beams from this energetic current.

By the cycle's close, a fully radiant navigation shines - its glow vibrantly maintaining sync with any fluctuations to content below.

We've now illuminated a dynamically adaptive component bringing the power of live data straight to the frontend. Let's preview the illuminated navigation in action to observe its brilliant illumination!

The stage is set - hit preview to see our live links sparkle to vibrant life. The power of Liquid is switching the navigation on!


## Build Navigation Links

To populate each navigation item, we'll output an `<a>` anchor tag nested within an `<li>` list item. 

Within the `for` loop, add this code:

```liquid
<li>
  <a href="{{ section.url }}">
    {{ section.title }}
  </a>
</li>
```

The anchor tag receives the dynamic `section.url` as its `href` attribute. This ensures each link points to the associated page.

We display the human-friendly `section.title` as the visible link text. 

And for valid HTML, don't forget to close the anchor and list item tags:

```liquid
  </a>
</li>
```

Now on each iteration of the loop, a full navigation link will be inserted into the list. The anchor text and destination respond directly to changes in section data.

Let's take a look at how this dynamically built navigation appears on the frontend!



## Conditionals For Active Link

We can use Liquid logic to underscore the corresponding navigation item for each page viewed. 

Wrap the anchor tag in an `if` statement to isolate the fitting section:

```liquid 
{% if section.id == page.section.id %}
```

This checks whether the looped section ID aligns with the active section holding the page.

Apply a class to stress the relevant selection:

```liquid
<li>
  <a href="{{ section.url }}" class="accented-link">
   {{ section.title }}   
  </a>
</li>
```

Close out the conditional phrase:

```liquid
{% endif %}
```

Now solely the navigation item relevant to the current page will be italicized by the "accented-link" modifier.

On every request, the pertaining path receives emphasis to smoothly steer site visitors where they require to wander. Preview to observe the conditional accent in play! 

Our navigation systematically underscores the material route through strategic conditional stressing.

## Add Missing Nesting Tags

Let's close out the full navigation markup.

To properly nest our list items, close the outer `<ul>` tag:

```liquid
</ul>
```

And for each iteration, remember to close the `<li>` as well: 

```liquid
  </li>
```

Now when we output the full navigation bar code, it will be valid HTML:

```liquid
<nav>
  <ul>
    {% for section in sections %}

      <li>
        <!-- link code -->  
      </li>

    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</nav>
```

This fully encloses both the unordered list and each list item.

With the nesting tags in place, our dynamically generated navigation will render cleanly on the front-end.

Let's preview the final output - the navigation should now display properly closed and nested list items.

## Implementing a Consistent Global Navigation

To provide an intuitive experience for all users, we'll add our navigation markup into the core template structure.

### Inserting the Semantic Navigation Block

We can output the `<nav>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>` elements by including this Liquid in our layout header:

```liquid
{{ 'navbar' | liquid }}
```  

This spritzes consistent semantics throughout shared templates.

### Validating the Structural Implementation 

Refreshing a page allows screening how semantics populate across interfaces as engineered. 

The navigation relationships between list elements should permeate cohesively as a defined parent-child hierarchy. 

With structure injected at the layout level, all interfaces inherit built-in accessibility guarantees. The intrinsic semantics navigate users fluidly wherever they go on our site.

By integrating the navigation block once, its meaning and function maintain integrity globally. Let's review - the system should guide all patrons uniformly!


## Conclusion
